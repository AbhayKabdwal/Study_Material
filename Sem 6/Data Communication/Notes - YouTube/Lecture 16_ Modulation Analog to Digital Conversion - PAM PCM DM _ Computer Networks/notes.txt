modulation is done at sender side
demodulation is done at receiver side

digitization or analog to digital conversion -> process of converting analog signal to digital signal

PAM
	-> interval in PAM should be double of the frequency of the data
	-> it is not full-fleged method to convert the signal

how to determine 'L' (number of levels/zones)?
	-> the more fluctuation in data, more the value of 'L' and vice-versa.

delta must not be in decimal. Round it off if it come in decimal
